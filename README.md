Exploratory Data Analysis

Boston_Marathon_simpleplots.py
Simple python code created in iPython to create some exporatory graphs from the 2016 Boston Marathon. 

BostonvsMarathonGuide.py
Coding in progress for comparison analysis between Marathon Guide data for all marathons run in 2015-2016 to the 2016 Boston Marathon results.

Note: values plotted on the x-axis are athletes who don't have a registered half marathon chip time for Boston 2016. Also, note the spread of the data. For an evenly run race, the data should match a linear relationship of y = 1/2x + b. However, very few athletes can achieve this, specifically with the course profile at Boston. The first 10k of the race is a net downhill, which makes holding an even pace more difficult when approaching the Newton hills from miles 18-22. Comparing values for individuals that approach this linear relationship to their marathon frequency may help determine what athlete profiles yield Boston "success".

Deltavofftime.png:
Graph showing the difference (delta) of the first vs. second half of the Boston Marathon against the total marathon time. Those who ran evenly should be at zero on the y-axis. Note that most data trend above this line. This data is uncleaned as of yet, as noted by the datapoints with an approx. y=ax+b relationship in the upper left quadrant of the graph. Participants to be focused on as having run "well" at 2016 Boston Marathon fall at or below the y=0 line.
